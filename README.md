So, I lost almost my entire Apple Music library due to not renewing sub and dicey manual syncing.
Didn't think I'd care but now I'm pissed at myself so I'm making this.

Repo is currently init w/ Turborepo along with some tiny amounts of boilerplate I was messing with.

Had a project idea though to learn Go and this might just replace that.

Still deciding - when I have time anyway
